## 1. Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions

**作者**: Abhishek Rath

**类别**: cs.AI

**链接**: [2601.04170v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04170v1)

**总结**:
- [Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04170v1)
  - Abhishek Rath
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.07
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences, with three distinct manifestations: semantic, coordination, and behavioral drift.
    - Proposes the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency and inter-agent agreement rates.
    - Proposes three mitigation strategies—episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring—to reduce drift-related errors in production agentic AI systems.

**总结**:
- [ContextFocus: Activation Steering for Contextual Faithfulness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04131v1)
  - Nikhil Anand, Shwetha Somasundaram, Anirudh Phukan, Apoorv Saxena, Koyel Mukherjee
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.07
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency, requiring no model finetuning.
    - The method is evaluated on the ConFiQA benchmark, showing significant improvements over baselines and remaining effective on larger models and complementary to prompting strategies.
