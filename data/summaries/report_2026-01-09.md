**总结**:
- [More Than Meets the Eye? Uncovering the Reasoning-Planning Disconnect in Training Vision-Language Driving Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04532)
  - Xurui Song, Shuo Huai, JingJing Jiang, Jiayi Kong, Jun Luo
  - Publish Date: 2025.10.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Datasets: [nuPlan](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan)
  - Summary：
    - Introduces DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) automatically generated from nuPlan to investigate the causal link between reasoning and planning in VLM driving agents.
    - Presents evidence of a consistent causal disconnect between reasoning and planning, proposing the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis where reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal mediator.
    - Proposes a novel, training-free diagnostic probe to measure an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating planning robustness against minor input perturbations.

**总结**:
- [PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18982)
  - Tim Kreuzer, Jelena Zdravkovic, Panagiotis Papapetrou
  - Publish Date: 2025.08.26
  - Task: Prediction
  - Summary：
    - PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models via localized input perturbations, providing multi-granular explanations.
    - The method characterizes cross-channel correlations for multivariate forecasts and identifies six recurring explanation pattern classes that are indicators of model performance.
