- [ThinkDrive: Chain-of-Thought Guided Progressive Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04714)
  - Chang Zhao, Zheming Yang, Yunqing Hu, Qi Guo, Zijian Wang, Pengcheng Li, Wen Ji
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.08
  - Task: Planning
  - Summary：
    - ThinkDrive, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided progressive reinforcement learning fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization.
    - The method employs a two-stage training strategy: first performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using CoT explanations, then applying progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer.
    - Evaluation on a public dataset shows ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines and a 2B-parameter model trained with this method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o on the exam metric.

    - Employs a two-stage training strategy: first SFT using CoT explanations, then progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity.
    - Outperforms strong RL baselines on key metrics and shows a 2B-parameter model trained with this method surpasses GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

  - Publisher: Washington University in St. Louis, Bosch Research
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.07
  - Project Page: [UniDrive-WM](https://unidrive-wm.github.io/UniDrive-WM)
  - Task: Planning
  - Datasets: [Bench2Drive](https://bench2drive.github.io/)
  - Summary：
    - UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture.
    - The model's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames, providing supervisory signals that enhance understanding and refine trajectory generation.
    - Experiments on Bench2Drive show UniDrive-WM improves planning by 5.9% in L2 error and 9.2% in collision rate over prior methods, demonstrating advantages of integrating VLM reasoning, planning, and generative modeling.

- [FROST-Drive: Scalable and Efficient End-to-End Driving with a Frozen Vision Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03460)
  - Zeyu Dong, Yimin Zhu, Yu Wu, Yu Sun
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: End-to-End
  - Datasets: [Waymo Open E2E Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/)
  - Summary：
    - FROST-Drive, a novel End-to-End (E2E) architecture that preserves the generalization of a pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) by keeping its vision encoder frozen for autonomous driving.
    - The model combines the frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter and a GRU-based decoder for waypoint generation, and introduces a custom loss to optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS).
    - Experiments on the Waymo Open E2E Dataset show the frozen-encoder approach outperforms full fine-tuning, offering a new pathway for robust, generalizable vision-based driving models.
