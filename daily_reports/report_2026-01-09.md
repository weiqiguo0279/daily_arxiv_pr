  - Summary：
    - Introduces an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method for LiDAR that leverages temporal-geometric consistency to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision models into 3D without manual input.
    - Proposes a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency and detects moving objects from inconsistencies, producing 3D semantic labels, bounding boxes, and densified LiDAR scans.
    - Demonstrates robust generalization across datasets and shows that even a small fraction of the generated densified LiDAR significantly improves long-range depth prediction.
