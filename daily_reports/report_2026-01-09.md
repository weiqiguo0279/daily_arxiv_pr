- [More Than Meets the Eye? Uncovering the Reasoning-Planning Disconnect in Training Vision-Language Driving Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04532)
  - Xurui Song, Shuo Huai, JingJing Jiang, Jiayi Kong, Jun Luo
  - Publish Date: 2025.10.06
  - Task: Reasoning, Planning
  - Datasets: [nuPlan](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan)
  - Summary：
    - Introduces DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) automatically generated from nuPlan to investigate the causal link between reasoning and planning in VLM driving agents.
    - Presents evidence for a Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, showing planning primarily relies on priors rather than the generated reasoning, and proposes a novel training-free diagnostic probe to measure an agent's reliance on priors.

- [EarthSE: A Benchmark for Evaluating Earth Scientific Exploration Capability of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17139)
  - Wanghan Xu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuhao Zhou, Xiaoyu Yue, Ben Fei, Fenghua Ling, Wenlong Zhang, Lei Bai
  - Publish Date: 2025.05.22
  - Project Page: [EarthSE](https://huggingface.co/ai-earth)
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Datasets: [Earth-Iron](https://huggingface.co/ai-earth), [Earth-Silver](https://huggingface.co/ai-earth), [Earth-Gold](https://huggingface.co/ai-earth)
  - Summary：
    - EarthSE, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Earth scientific exploration, spanning from fundamental to advanced levels.
    - The benchmark introduces two Question Answering datasets (Earth-Iron and Earth-Silver) and a novel open-ended multi-turn dialogue dataset (Earth-Gold) to assess capabilities including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept proposal.
    - Extensive experiments on 11 leading LLMs reveal significant limitations in their scientific exploration capabilities across five Earth spheres, 114 disciplines, and 11 task categories.

- [Attention Mechanisms Perspective: Exploring LLM Processing of Graph-Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02130)
  - Zhong Guan, Likang Wu, Hongke Zhao, Ming He, Jianpin Fan
  - Publish Date: 2025.05.04
  - Code: [LLM4Exploration](https://github.com/millioniron/LLM_exploration)
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - An empirical study exploring how LLMs process graph-structured data from the perspective of attention mechanisms, uncovering unique phenomena in their attention application.
    - Key findings show LLMs struggle to model inter-node relationships in graphs due to architectural constraints and their attention distribution fails to adapt to graph topology nuances.
    - Proposes that intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training for graphs and can transition to fully connected windows during inference.
