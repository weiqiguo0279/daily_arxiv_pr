  - Summary：
    - Introduces VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline to convert general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies, finding it surprisingly competitive with more complex designs.
    - Through extensive studies, finds that a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream embodied task performance, challenging common assumptions.
    - Identifies the visual module in VLMs as the primary performance bottleneck and shows that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder yields consistent gains.
