- [Lane-Frame Quantum Multimodal Driving Forecasts for the Trajectory of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17675)
  - Navneet Singh, Shiva Raj Pokhrel
  - Publish Date: 2025.11.21
  - Task: Prediction
  - Datasets: [Waymo Open Motion Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/)
  - Summary：
    - Proposes a compact hybrid quantum architecture for trajectory forecasting, using an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame to predict residual corrections to a kinematic baseline.
    - The model combines a quantum attention encoder, a quantum feedforward stack, and a Fourier-based decoder to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences from the latent spectrum.
    - Trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), it achieves improved minADE and minFDE on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, demonstrating stable optimization from small, shallow quantum circuits.

  - Publish Date: 2025.10.06
  - Task: Planning
  - Datasets: [nuPlan](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan)
  - Summary：
    - Introduces DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) automatically generated from nuPlan, designed to investigate the causal relationship between reasoning and planning in VLM driving agents.
    - Presents evidence for a consistent causal disconnect (Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis), where planning primarily relies on priors rather than the generated reasoning, and proposes a novel, training-free diagnostic probe to measure an agent's reliance on priors.

  - Publish Date: 2025.09.18

  - Summary：
    - Explores Implicit Behavioral Cloning (IBC) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to capture multimodal driving decisions where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario.
    - Proposes Data-Augmented IBC (DA-IBC), which improves learning by perturbing expert actions for counterexamples and using better initialization for derivative-free inference.
    - Demonstrates that DA-IBC outperforms standard IBC in CARLA simulator urban driving tasks, with learned energy landscapes representing multimodal action distributions that standard Behavior Cloning fails to achieve.

  - Code: [Diffusion Scaling](https://diffusion-scaling.github.io)
  - Summary：
    - Systematically studies masked diffusion language models in data-constrained settings, finding they outperform autoregressive models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
    - Derives new scaling laws for diffusion models and a closed-form expression for the compute threshold where diffusion begins to outperform autoregressive modeling.
    - Explains the advantage via diffusion's randomized masking objective, which acts as implicit data augmentation over token orderings, a benefit lacking in fixed left-to-right autoregressive factorization.
