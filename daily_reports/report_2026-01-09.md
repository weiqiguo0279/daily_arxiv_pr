  - Summary：
    - Mesh4D, a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction, reconstructs a dynamic object's complete 3D shape and motion as a deformation field from a video.

- [Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05245)
  - Natalie Collina, Jiuyao Lu, Georgy Noarov, Aaron Roth
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.08
  - Summary：
    - Proves tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
    - In the general setting, proves an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using three disjoint binary groups, matching known upper bounds and exceeding the upper bound for marginal calibration.
    - For group functions dependent only on context, establishes an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.
