  - Task: Planning
  - Summary：
    - ThinkDrive, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization.
    - Employs a two-stage training strategy: first SFT using CoT explanations, then progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity.
    - Outperforms strong RL baselines on key metrics and shows a 2B-parameter model trained with this method surpasses GPT-4o on the exam metric.
