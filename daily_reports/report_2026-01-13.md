- [Efficient Visual Question Answering Pipeline for Autonomous Driving via Scene Region Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07092)
  - Yuliang Cai, Dongqiangzi Ye, Zitian Chen, Chongruo Wu
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.11
  - Task: VQA
  - Summary：
    - Proposes SRC-Pipeline, an efficient VLM framework for autonomous driving VQA that compresses early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while keeping full tokens for recent frames.
    - Achieves a 66% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more effective real-time operation in safety-critical driving settings.
