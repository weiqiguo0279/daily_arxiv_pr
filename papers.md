    - CHORD, a universal generative pipeline for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes to synthesize diverse 4D scene dynamics.
    - The method distills Lagrangian motion information from the Eulerian representations of 2D videos, offering a category-agnostic approach.

- [Transforming Video Subjective Testing with Training, Engagement, and Real-Time Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04184)
  - Kumar Rahul, Sriram Sethuraman, Andrew Segall, Yixu Chen
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.07
  - Task: VQA
  - Summary：
    - Proposes an integrated framework for subjective video quality assessment that enhances rater training, enforces attention via real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons.
    - Introduces a three-phase approach: an automated training quiz, real-time attention scoring with penalties, and an efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure to recover quality scores in JOD units.
    - Experiments with 80 participants show the training-quiz improves data quality, and real-time feedback further improves quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings, aiding objective metric training.

- [Embedding Autonomous Agents in Resource-Constrained Robotic Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04191)
