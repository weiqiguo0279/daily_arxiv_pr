# 🚗 Autonomous Driving VLM/VLA Papers

- [Heavy Black-Holes Also Matter in Standard Siren Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03257)
  - Grégoire Pierra, Alexander Papadopoulos
  - Publisher: LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Datasets: [GWTC-4.0](https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC/)
  - Summary：
    - Investigates the impact of a novel parametric model for the full population mass spectrum of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) on Hubble constant estimation, focusing on heavy black holes.
    - Performs joint inference using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with spectral and dark siren methods, reporting improved constraints: $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}$ km/s/Mpc (spectral) and $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}$ km/s/Mpc (dark sirens).
    - Attributes the ~30-36% uncertainty improvement to a new mass scale in the binary black hole spectrum at ~63.3 $M_{\odot}$, highlighting the importance of heavy-mass features for cosmology.

- [Standard Model Higgs Peaks: a Note on the Vacuum Instability during Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03231)
  - G. Franciolini, A. Kehagias, A. Riotto
  - Publisher: University of Geneva, National Technical University of Athens
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Proposes using extreme-value statistics of Higgs field peaks during inflation as the correct framework to assess vacuum instability, offering a qualitatively distinct bound.
    - Derives a bound on the Hubble rate during inflation that is a factor of sqrt(2) stronger than commonly adopted bounds to avoid catastrophic vacuum decay.

- [Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254)
  - Bastien Vanderplaetse, Xavier Siebert, Stéphane Dupont
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm to extract patterns in messages from agents trained on the Lewis Game for emergent communication.
    - Aims to improve the interpretability of emergent languages by relating extracted message patterns to specific attributes of the input data.

- [Muses: Designing, Composing, Generating Nonexistent Fantasy 3D Creatures without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03256)
  - Hexiao Lu, Xiaokun Sun, Zeyu Cai, Hao Guo, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Zhenyu Zhang
  - Publisher: Nanjing University of Science and Technology
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Project Page: [Muses](https://luhexiao.github.io/Muses.github.io/)
  - Task: Generation
  - Summary：
    - Muses, a training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation using a feed-forward, structure-aware pipeline based on 3D skeletons.
    - The method formalizes creation into design, composition, and generation stages: graph-constrained skeleton construction, voxel-based assembly in latent space, and skeletal-conditioned texture modeling.
    - It achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and text alignment, enabling flexible 3D object editing without domain limitations.

- [Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254)
  - Bastien Vanderplaetse, Xavier Siebert, Stéphane Dupont
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm to extract patterns in messages exchanged by agents in the Lewis Game, aiding the interpretation of emergent languages.
    - Focuses on the interpretability of emergent communication in multi-agent systems, relating extracted message patterns to specific attributes of the input data to simplify analysis.
