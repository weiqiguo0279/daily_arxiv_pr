# 🚗 Autonomous Driving VLM/VLA Papers

- [Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254)
  - Bastien Vanderplaetse, Xavier Siebert, Stéphane Dupont
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm to extract relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents in the Lewis Game.
    - ASRD aids the interpretation of emergent communication by relating extracted message patterns to specific attributes of the input data, simplifying analysis.

- [ReCCur: A Recursive Corner-Case Curation Framework for Robust Vision-Language Understanding in Open and Edge Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03011)
  - Yihan Wei, Shenghai Yuan, Tianchen Deng, Boyang Lou, Enwen Hu
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Code: [ReCCur](https://github.com/) (Inferred placeholder)
  - Task: Perception
  - Summary：
    - ReCCur, a low-compute framework for converting noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline to address corner cases.
    - The framework uses a three-stage process: large-scale data acquisition and filtering, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation, and region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling.
    - Designed to run on consumer-grade GPUs with minimal human supervision, it steadily improves label purity and separability for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints.

- [Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254)
  - Bastien Vanderplaetse, Xavier Siebert, Stéphane Dupont
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Reasoning
  - Summary：
    - Proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm to extract patterns in messages exchanged by agents in the Lewis Game, aiding the interpretation of emergent languages.
    - Focuses on improving the interpretability of communication strategies developed autonomously by multi-agent systems without explicit programming.

- [Enhancing Safety in Automated Ports: A Virtual Reality Study of Pedestrian-Autonomous Vehicle Interactions under Time Pressure, Visual Constraints, and Varying Vehicle Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03218)
  - Yuan Che, Mun On Wong, Xiaowei Gao, Haoyang Liang, Yun Ye
  - Publish Date: 2026.01.06
  - Task: Perception
  - Summary：
    - Investigates how environmental factors, traffic factors, and pedestrian characteristics influence interaction safety between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in port environments using VR simulations.
    - Finds that low visibility, occlusions, and larger vehicle sizes increase perceived risk and crossing caution, while time pressure undermines compensatory behaviors and increases risk.
    - Proposes safety strategies including multi-viewpoint cameras, vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhanced lighting/signage, and pedestrian training to improve vision-based autonomous system deployment in ports.
