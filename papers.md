  - Task: Generation
  - Summary：
    - Muses, a training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation, leveraging a 3D skeleton to explicitly compose diverse elements in a feed-forward paradigm.
    - The method formalizes creation as a structure-aware pipeline: graph-constrained skeleton design, voxel-based assembly in a structured latent space, and image-guided appearance modeling.
