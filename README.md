  - Summary：
    - UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture.
    - The model's predicted trajectory conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames, providing supervisory signals that enhance understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation.
    - Experiments on Bench2Drive show improvements of 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over previous methods, demonstrating advantages of integrating reasoning, planning, and generative modeling.

  - Task: Planning
  - Datasets: [RELLIS-3D](https://github.com/unmannedlab/RELLIS-3D)
  - Summary：
    - Proposes OFF-EMMA, an end-to-end multimodal framework for off-road autonomous driving, addressing insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in VLA models.
    - Introduces a visual prompt block using semantic segmentation masks to enhance spatial understanding and a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to improve planning robustness.
